            <h2>Song 1 - You and Me </h2>
            <p>[Verse 1]
                You know I gotcha
                You know that I got you like that
                Ain't nobody gonna have your back like the way I do
                You love it, just say you do
                You know you got me
                Everything you do, everything you did
                Everything I wish I was with, makes me feel alright
                I'm just saying, so
                
                [Pre-Chorus]
                I really like it
                Nothin' in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do
                I really like it
                Nothin' in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do
                
                [Chorus]
                I love you and me
                Dancing in the moonlight
                Nobody can see
                It's just you and me tonight
                I love you and me
                Dancing in the moonlight
                Nobody can see
                It's just you and me tonight

                [Post-Chorus]
                Look at you, now look at me
                How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
                Look at you, now look at me
                How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
                
                [Verse 2]
                You're the reason my heart skips, drops
                Just a little touch, my world stops
                Finally, I know that you're mine
                I don't wanna fall
                Don't wanna play this game of love, oh-eh-oh
                There's nowhere to hide
                
                [Pre-Chorus]
                I really like it
                Nothing in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do
                I really like it
                Nothing in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do
                
                [Chorus]
                I love you and me
                Dancing in the moonlight
                Nobody can see
                It's just you and me tonight
                I love you and me
                Dancing in the moonlight
                Nobody can see
                It's just you and me tonight
                
                
                [Post-Chorus]
                Look at you, now look at me
                How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
                Look at you, now look at me
                How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
                
                [Interlude]
                (Ever, ever gonna find someone like this)
                (Someone like this)
                
                [Bridge]
                I don't care 'bout your first love
                This should be your last one
                Nothin' like your last one
                You look better on me, that's fashion
                Won't block your shots, lights, camera, action
                Never been a love me or a love me not thing
                Every petal better tell him, better not change
                I love you, I love me a lot, wait
                Which one I love better? Better off not saying
                
                [Outro]
                I love you and me</p>
